# Harvest My Likes

Use Chrome or the built-in browser through the agent's browser tools. Follow the user's browser choice; otherwise prefer a signed-in session. Do not use `agent-browser`. If neither browser has access, ask the user to sign in.

## Read posts

Open the supplied post URLs; for a bare status ID, use `https://x.com/i/status/ID`.

- Match the target status ID so replies and quoted posts do not replace the requested post.
- Expand truncated text and open longform articles to capture the full body, not just the preview.
- Keep quoted posts separate, with their author and source link when available.
- Preserve paragraphs, mentions, emoji, and working link destinations. Avoid inserting line breaks between inline spans or copying shortened display URLs.
- For an unavailable post, report the URL and the access or loading problem. Do not infer its content from nearby posts.

Return the content the user requested. For larger batches, use targeted browser reads to keep unrelated timeline content out of context.

## Collect likes

Open `https://x.com/i/history/likes` in the signed-in browser and confirm the Likes tab. X also redirects the profile's `/HANDLE/likes` URL there. For scrapbook updates, read the existing file first and collect its status IDs for deduplication.

Collect unique post URLs in timeline order, keeping each top-level post separate from its quoted links. Stop at the first known status, the requested count, the end of the timeline, or no progress. Open the collected URLs to read their full content.

Default to at most 25 new posts and 8 timeline scrolls per batch. Long X timelines can consume several GiB of browser memory. Save a partial batch and report where collection stopped; do not increase those limits to force a catch-up. Close tabs you created when done, preserving the user's existing tabs.

Merge new entries without duplicating status IDs or rewriting existing notes. Preserve the destination's format. Keep timeline order; a post's publication date does not tell you when the user liked it.

## Optional Obsidian archive

Use `scripts/render_x_archive_markdown.mjs` when the user wants a local archive with downloaded images. Otherwise write the requested output directly.

The renderer accepts a JSON array of posts or an object with a `posts` array. Each post uses `url`, `id` (a string), `author_handle`, `author_name`, `created_at`, and `text`. Optional fields:

- `author_url`
- `markdown`: formatted content, including quoted posts with attribution and source links; overrides `text` in the archive
- `media`: image objects with `url`, optional `download_url`, and `alt`; distinguish video thumbnails from video files
- `reason`: an extraction problem to show in the archive

```bash
node scripts/render_x_archive_markdown.mjs \
  --input /path/to/posts.json \
  --output /path/to/archive.md \
  --attachments-dir attachments \
  --image-width 360
```

Resolve the script path relative to this skill. The renderer writes a new archive; merge it into an existing scrapbook separately. Check the result for missing content, broken mentions or URLs, and failed image downloads.
